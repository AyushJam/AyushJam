- Hi, I’m @AyushJam, a grad student at UC San Diego studying computational imaging.
- I graduated from IIT Madras with a BTech in Electrical Engineering in 2024.
- I’m interested in image systems and signal processing.
- I'm also a contributor to the ISET (Image Systems Engineering Toolbox) ecosystem — added Octave support and improved ISET3D’s rendering pipeline by fixing recipe parsing, mix material handling, and centralized asset usage.
- Beyond academics, I play the piano, and I love reading science and history. 
- How to reach me? Here's my email - ayushjamdar@gmail.com
